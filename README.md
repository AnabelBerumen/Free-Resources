## 📝 About This Repository

**Free Resources** is a living space built from my passion for continuous learning.  
Here, I will be collecting materials, notes, and free resources that have helped (or will help) me grow in the fields I enjoy the most: **data science, machine learning, deep learning, data engineering, statistics, mathematics, SQL, Python**, and anything that strengthens my technical skills and professional development.

My goal is to keep expanding this repository with topics that spark curiosity, meaningful challenges worth exploring, and content that might be useful for others on their learning journey.  
Feel free to browse, contribute, or draw inspiration from it.

**Always learning. Always sharing.**
